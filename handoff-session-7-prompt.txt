Future-CoT reminder (reference: handoff-session-7.md)

Goal: Continue HMM Lab work without drifting. Read handoff-session-7.md first; it captures state, saved runs, profiles, scheduler, endpoints, and next steps. Do NOT jump into a plan until you clarify with the user. Stay grounded, no hype, be concise and humble.

Key operating notes:
- Backend: uvicorn/FASTAPI at http://localhost:8000; check pid (`ps -ef | grep uvicorn`). DuckDB locks while server runs; stop server before direct DB access.
- Frontend: hmm-dashboard.html (JS v=5). Profiles dropdown controls modes (Legacy, Scaled, Scaled+Auto-K). No legacy checkbox.
- Data/session: 1m Binance BTC/USDT base; aggregated TFs on the fly. Scheduler should ingest every 5m and on startup. Verify in server.log.
- Saved runs are timestamped (exchange_symbol_timeframe_ts). Load Run should render immediately; prob card auto-refresh is separate (latest every ~15s). Probability card shows numeric latest probs.
- Legacy look: Profile=Legacy, K=3, Auto-K off. Colors Bear/Chop/Bull.
- Outstanding: confirm scheduler actually runs; add last-updated badge; consider new feature profiles (e.g., MA slopes + ATR) later; clean old non-ts models after verification; add degenerate-state warnings.

Behavioral guardrails:
- Don’t make a plan until you confer with the user about priorities.
- No overhyped/marketing language; stay factual and terse.
- Before editing, reread handoff-session-7.md and current `git status`.
- If fetch/locks occur, check DuckDB lock (server may be running) before diagnosing.
- Research first if needed; exit plan mode only after alignment with the user.
