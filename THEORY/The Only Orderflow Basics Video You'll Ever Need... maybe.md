0:00
these are orderflow charts and they
0:02
allow you to have a deeper layer of
0:04
Market information that 90% of retail
0:06
Traders aren't even aware of and can
0:08
give you an almost unfair advantage on
0:11
all other price action day Traders as I
0:13
said before it's like having a normal
0:14
bow and arrow or using a ballistic
0:16
professional option in both cases you
0:18
have to be the one who's [ __ ] good at
0:20
throwing the arrow but once you master
0:21
it the chances of being completely
0:23
accurate and precise are way higher with
0:25
a ballistic option or it's like using a
0:27
normal sniper rifle versus using one
0:29
with night vision optic with the
0:31
upgraded version you can see things that
0:33
you simply cannot see with a normal one
0:35
this is why you should consider
0:37
implementing orderflow in your strategy
0:39
this is the second of a series of videos
0:41
I'm making about these tools which is a
0:43
complete video course that will take you
0:45
from zero to step by step learning how
0:47
to read and interpret correctly what
0:49
orderflow is doing and Implement new
0:51
edges and new strategies especially if
0:53
you're a price action Trader cuz not
0:55
only orderflow can help you being way
0:57
more objective in understanding short
1:00
term Market mechanics because you don't
1:01
have to guess where an imbalance is you
1:03
can see it with orders you don't have to
1:05
guess where a stop run is or where
1:07
liquidity is cuz you can actually see
1:09
them so not only will you be way more
1:11
objective with your Market view but this
1:14
new layer of objectivity can radically
1:16
mitigate the amount of interpretation
1:19
and discretion that you might need in
1:21
your price action strategy so as I said
1:23
this is the second of a series of videos
1:25
I'm making about this tool so subscribe
1:27
to the channel and click the Bell if you
1:28
want to see the next episodes in case I
1:30
will leave you the link to the full
1:31
playlist Down Below in this specific
1:33
video we will talk about the order book
1:35
or the depth of market so today I will
1:37
try to open your mind or how price
1:40
actually moves why does price move which
1:42
is a mechanic that 95% of retail Traders
1:46
have no idea of which is [ __ ] crazy
1:49
so buckle up take a pencil and paper and
1:51
enjoy the video what we will learn now
2 Types of Liquidity
1:53
is Market mechanics and I'm talking
1:55
about the real Market mechanics a lot of
1:58
people don't even know how prices are
2:01
delivered what's the actual mechanic
2:03
behind it let's start by saying that
2:05
markets are made of orders you know buy
2:07
and sell orders these orders are also
2:09
called liquidity a market is defined
2:11
liquid if it's easy to find a
2:13
counterparty to your trades so liquidity
2:15
is the counterparty so any order in the
2:18
market is liquidity and most people in
2:20
the price action smart money space think
2:23
that liquidity are just buy stops or
2:24
sell stop or stop losses above a high or
2:27
below a low supply and demand Traders
2:29
instead think that liquidity is resting
2:32
order in a previous area of Supply or
2:34
resting orders in a previous area of
2:36
demand orders that were left there in
2:38
that zone all of these are true but
2:41
partial because you have to know that
2:42
you have two different kinds of
2:44
liquidity market makers and Market
2:46
takers also known as passive liquidity
2:49
and aggressive liquidity to understand
2:50
this even better you can imagine the
2:53
market makers as a menu the catalog of
2:55
the market so you have a bunch of buy
2:57
orders in the menu and you have a bunch
2:59
of sell orders in the menu so here's
3:01
there's buy orders and here's there is
3:04
sell orders this is the menu so as long
3:06
as there's a menu there are some Goods
3:09
that are being let's say sold but if no
3:11
one is coming to buy them nothing will
3:13
happen so outside here you have the
3:15
clients wants to take stuff from the
3:17
menu these are Market takers or
3:19
aggressive liquidity the menu is market
3:22
makers or passive liquidity so there's
3:24
one side of the market both buyers and
3:26
sellers which are presenting their order
3:29
like a menu like an auction and then
3:31
there is aggressive liquidity which are
3:33
the clients who actively go and take
3:36
those thing in the menu the real life
Orderbook
3:38
version of the menu is this which is the
3:40
order book also know as cob the central
3:44
limit order book or the depth of Market
3:46
Doom so these are buy orders and sell
3:50
orders and more technically they are buy
3:52
limits and sell limits so these are
3:55
passive buyers these are passive sellers
3:58
they are waiting for some client to come
4:00
and order something from the menu so all
4:02
around here are a bunch of clients are a
4:04
bunch of Market participants that are
4:07
going to interact with this menu trying
4:10
to buy and sell at the best prices now
4:12
the first level we will call the best
4:14
bid this other level will'll call it the
4:16
best ask so the level at which there is
4:18
the first available buy contract in the
4:21
book is called the best bid same thing
4:23
for sell contract in the ask now just to
4:25
give you an example this is an actual
4:27
order book this is the price and and
4:29
this is the ask so as you can see I
4:31
drawn it pretty [ __ ] accurately so I
4:33
think the video deserves a like just for
4:34
that so if these are limits order which
4:37
as we discussed in the previous video
4:38
can be entries like a simple buy limit
4:41
and sell limit but also take profits cuz
4:43
if I bought say here I will put my take
4:46
profit right above here as a minus sell
4:49
order instead all the rest of the
4:52
liquidity which is aggressive liquidity
4:54
is people actually clicking the buy or
4:57
sell button so Market orders and and
5:00
stop orders so what you would consider a
5:02
breakout entry or a stop- loss so same
5:05
example if I bought here one contract
5:07
and here I will put my take profit which
5:09
is a sell limit because it's above the
5:11
price I will put my sell stop below here
5:14
but here's this buy orders there's buy
5:17
limits in the order book so I can't put
5:18
my sell stop in this part of the order
5:21
book my stop order will be set in my
5:24
brokerage account will be executed at
5:26
the best ask or the best bid so let's
5:29
say you buy now one contract Market you
5:33
will be executed exactly at this price
5:36
why because if you're buying and you
5:38
want to buy now the first contract
5:40
available for sale at the best price you
5:43
can get is right here so let's say you
5:45
buy one contract from here this from six
5:48
will become five contracts you just ate
5:50
one contract that was in the order book
5:52
so this which is the last price at which
5:56
at least one order has been executed is
5:58
the current price now now we're going to
6:00
take this contract and save it as a
6:02
reminder in this other table here which
6:04
is what we're going to call a footprint
Footprint Candles
6:06
or an orderflow candle so one contract
6:09
was taken from those six Has Lifted the
6:12
ask we say so one contract has been
6:14
executed here now let's say that someone
6:15
else is coming and wants to sell Market
6:18
a contract sell minus one market it will
6:22
be executed at the best possible bid at
6:24
the best possible level where there is
6:27
at least one buy contract in the menu so
6:29
one contract of those fives will be
6:31
taken so this will become four and we
6:33
will remember this was executed here
6:35
there was one order that hit the bid in
6:38
all of this we have candlesticks so the
6:40
first order was executed here so here is
6:43
the open of the candle last order was
6:45
executed here so now the candle first of
6:48
all will turn as a short candle here we
6:50
will have a zero and a zero CU zero
6:52
contract has been executed at those
6:54
level but let's make another example
6:55
let's make an example where a guy comes
6:57
and wants to buy market right now
7:01
because he needs it he can't wait any
7:02
longer 10 contracts where is he going to
7:05
execute those 10 contracts well five of
7:08
them will be executed if he wants to buy
7:10
them they will be executed five of them
7:12
so five of them will be executed right
7:15
here so five contracts goes away from
7:17
here here is zero and those five
7:19
contract will be added to that contract
7:21
that was executed here so we will write
7:23
six so he filled five contracts here but
7:26
he still needs five more to fill his
7:27
order so five of them will be taken Tak
7:29
from these nine so this will become four
7:31
and five contracts will be executed
7:33
right here because since now there's
7:35
zero contract here the best ask will
7:37
become this one so these 10 order has
7:39
been executed and now the candle from
7:42
here went in one order in 1 millisecond
7:45
here and became a long candle and left
7:48
us a little Wick over here so the
7:50
current price is this one the current
7:53
price is the last price at which at
7:55
least one order has been executed now
7:56
let's say that at the same time someone
7:58
wants to come and sell 10 more contracts
8:01
so if someone wants to sell Market 10
8:03
contracts they will be executed at the
8:05
best bid the best bid is here but only
8:07
four contracts can be executed here
8:09
which will go right here adding to this
8:11
one contract so they will become five
8:14
contracts and five more of those
8:15
contract will be executed at the new
8:17
best bid which is this one 10 contract
8:20
will be here five more contract will be
8:21
executed right here the candle will turn
8:25
and will leave us a wick above here so
8:27
now as you can see the distance between
8:29
between the best bid and the best ask is
8:31
a bit wider this is the raw spread or
8:34
the bid ask spread so where there is no
8:38
liquidity there is no market so we are
8:40
starting to understand some very
8:43
important things that where there is no
8:45
liquidity there is no market and there
8:48
is no price action but we also
8:50
understand that who moves the market
8:52
isn't passive liquidity but all those
8:55
aggressive guys that took an actual
8:58
action and didn't see simply wait for
9:00
their buy order or sell order to get
9:02
filled maybe but who couldn't wait and
9:06
accepted a slightly higher price as long
9:09
as they could buy or sell so aggressive
9:12
liquidity is people accepting worse
9:15
prices as long as they can buy or sell
9:18
they are the one who are actually moving
9:20
the markets so who moves the market who
9:23
moves the singular candle are aggressive
9:25
liquidity so this also means that that
9:28
the speed at which price goes down or up
9:31
both depends on how many aggressors
9:34
there are but also on how many passive
9:37
sellers there are cuz you can understand
9:39
that there if there is a 100 or 1,000
9:43
contract order right here if around the
9:46
same volume of aggressive sellers try to
9:48
hit this price and try to sell here it's
9:51
very hard for them to break that level
9:53
so if you will the first type of actual
9:55
support and resistance are sell limits
9:58
and buy limits these are the actual
10:00
Supply zones and demand zones the best
10:03
demand Zone in this area will be these
10:06
1,000 contract right here cuz they will
10:08
cause price to have a struggle here or
10:10
eventually give up and not attack that
10:12
level anymore now let's simulate other
10:14
order that has been executed or were
10:16
executed at these prices the footprint
10:18
is really cool because it tells us it
10:20
gives us a very detailed information
10:23
about aggressive buyers on this side and
10:25
aggressive sellers on this side and
10:27
please watch out these are are not just
10:30
buyers if this part has more contracts
10:32
it doesn't mean that there were more
10:34
buyers there's no such thing as more
10:36
buyers every buyers need a liquidity
10:38
needs a counterparty so every contract
10:40
that was executed here was an aggressive
10:43
buyer buying from a seller so there's no
10:46
such thing as the market is long Market
10:48
is not long Market is bullish price
Profiles
10:50
action is bullish but the market is
10:52
always both sided so what Footprints and
10:54
orderflow candle gives us is a detailed
10:57
explanation of who was more aggressive
10:59
but these are still all volume that's
11:01
why a very appreciated version of
11:03
orderflow is volume profile which very
11:06
simply adds the contracts makes an
11:08
addition between sold at the bid and
11:11
bought at the ask so here there will be
11:13
0 + 5 so let's say 5 let's say this
11:16
equals 5 7 + 6 13 so around here 5 + 4 =
11:21
9 5 + 0 = 5 again so this is our volume
11:25
profile it shows us the total
11:27
transaction on every price level without
11:29
any clear distinction between who was
11:32
more aggressive which by some can be
11:33
just considered as noise one thing you
11:35
will often see is that there will be a
11:37
level which has more contracts than
11:39
other more contracts were exchanged on
11:41
this level than all other levels this
11:43
level is defined as the point of control
11:47
P which is the point of the candle where
11:49
most contracts were traded now as I told
11:52
you this is the sum of bid plus ask if
11:55
instead of sum we make a difference
11:57
between ask and bid we will get the the
11:59
so-called Delta profile so 5 - 0 = + 5 7
12:04
- 6 6 - 7 = -1 4 - 5 = -1 0 - 5 = - 5 so
12:12
the Delta profile is simply showing us
12:15
in each of the individual levels who was
12:18
more aggressive at the end of the day
12:19
now this is an actual order book and as
12:22
you can see it's way faster than the one
12:24
I draw to you and all these contracts
12:26
that you see here are not going to stay
12:28
there forever they can be put there they
12:29
can be withdrawn so this is not
12:31
necessarily the best way or the most
12:34
effective way to look at the order book
12:36
instead we can use heat Maps which
12:38
basically gives us a map of the order
12:40
book that shows us exactly where the
12:43
highest liquidity areas are in the
12:46
market in the next videos we're going to
12:47
see how Market interacts with those Zone
12:50
with these zones how they change through
12:52
time and what to do with them all right
12:54

12:56
