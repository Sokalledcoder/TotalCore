I am paying $1,400 per year for only to
0:03
buy this trading data that gives me a
0:05
full understanding on every single order
0:08
in the markets if it's one big order or
0:10
if it's more small orders this is not
0:12
just any orderflow data this is what is
0:14
known as a market by order data feed and
0:17
if you have a platform that can properly
0:19
interpret these data it can give you a
0:21
huge informational advantage on all
0:24
other price action retail Traders out
0:25
there let's see how this works uh by the
0:27
way this is one of a series of videos
0:29
I'm making about orderflow it's a full
0:31
course so I'll leave you the playlist
0:32
down below I hope everything was clear
0:34
if it wasn't go back and see the First
0:36
videos that I made about this orderflow
0:38
course if you like this video leave a
0:39
like and a comment if you have any
0:40
question And subscribe to the channel to
0:42
see the next videos and that's it ciao
MBO vs MBP
0:45
just a quick recap on Market mechanics
0:47
we have two types of liquidity the one
0:48
in the order book is passive liquidity
0:51
buy limits in the bid and sell limits in
0:53
the ask the first two levels are the
0:54
best bid and the best ask then you have
0:56
aggressive liquidity which is basically
0:58
Market buyers and Market sellers
1:00
aggressive buyers and aggressive sellers
1:02
which buy or sell at the best bid or at
1:05
the best ask the contracts that are
1:07
available in the book once this
1:09
liquidity has been consumed the new best
1:11
bid and best ask can vary and this is
1:13
how price eventually moves and price
1:16
moves exactly where the last orders are
1:18
executed so if five more contracts were
1:20
executed here right now the candle will
1:22
turn green so with this visualization of
1:25
order flow we already have a deeper
1:26
layer of information than pure price
1:28
action but still we're only scratching
1:30
the surface of the information that
1:31
orderflow can actually provide because
1:33
with this form of orderflow we're just
1:34
seeing the market in every price level
1:37
that's why this form of order flow is
1:38
also known as Market by price because
1:41
you're seeing the market per every level
1:43
of price so Market by Price order flow
1:46
only shows us the total number of
1:48
resting orders at which price level and
1:50
the total number of aggressive orders at
1:52
which price level but if say we have 100
1:54
contracts here and 100 contracts here we
1:57
don't know if it's one big order for 100
1:59
contracts two big orders of 50 contracts
2:01
or 100 different orders worth one
2:03
contract each because we only know the
2:05
total number at a price level Market by
2:07
orders data feed instead doesn't only
2:09
show us the market per every price but
2:11
also the market in every single order so
2:14
maybe for those 100 contracts there's
2:15
going to be another 40 contracts order
2:17
here plus a 10 contracts order here and
2:19
another 10 contracts order here so with
2:21
Market by order data feeds we have a
2:23
granular understanding of order flow and
2:25
we can see with a much higher accuracy
2:27
how big participants how smart money are
2:30
manipulating order for but in order to
2:32
understand how this can actually help us
2:34
you should first know about matching
2:35
algorithms every exchange matching
2:37
algorithms are basically automatic rules
Matching Algorthims
2:40
that determines the interaction between
2:42
aggressive orders and resting orders and
2:44
these are all the orders in the best bit
2:46
so say we have 15 contracts here five
2:48
contracts here and 35 contracts here
2:51
which means we have one order for 15
2:52
contracts one order for five conss and
2:54
an order for 35 contracts and there's a
2:56
23 contracts order that was just s sent
3:00
to the exchange and now matching
3:02
algorithms has to pair with all the
3:04
contracts available in the resting
3:05
orders here the first and most common
3:07
matching algorithm is known as fifo or
3:10
fifo or fifo which stands for first in
3:13
first out so the first contract that was
3:16
put in the book is going to be the first
3:18
order to be executed as soon as someone
3:21
buys or sells so in this case
3:23
chronologically speaking first this 15
3:25
contract order was placed here then this
3:27
five contract order and then this 35
3:29
contracts order so if this aggressor
3:31
comes in who has the right to be
3:33
executed first of course this one
3:34
because it was put here before the rest
3:37
of the orders so 15 contracts of this
3:39
order will be executed here which means
3:42
now there's still 18 contracts in this
3:44
order that needs to be processed at the
3:46
best bid now five of these contracts
3:48
will be paired with these five contracts
3:50
here which leaves us with 13 contracts
3:52
now these 13 contracts will be mesed
3:55
with 13 of these 35 contracts in dis
3:58
order so regardless of the size of the
4:01
aggressor order the first resting order
4:03
which was put in the bit is going to be
4:04
executed first this is the most common
4:06
matching algorithm then you have also
4:08
fifo with lmm which means fifo with lead
4:12
Market maker this usually which means
4:14
that the exchange has a deal with the
Market Makers Model
4:16
particular operator that operates in
4:18
that market with one or more Market
4:20
participants that are acting as a lead
4:22
Market maker and what they do is
4:24
basically being sure that every level of
4:26
the book has liquidity so they Place
4:28
their orders in in every level of the
4:30
book to ensure that all aggressors are
4:33
going to find liquidity so since they
4:35
provide this service to The Exchange and
4:37
they help make the market more liquid
4:39
and more easy to trade they have the
4:41
right to be executed first at least at s
4:43
LEL and you could ask yourself what is
4:45
the business why do they provide
4:46
liquidity because the business model of
4:48
a market maker is to earn one tick for
4:51
every transaction that is happening so
4:52
basically they are buying here they are
4:54
selling here this is one tick so if for
4:57
example we're talking about the es
4:59
contract they're going to earn
5:01
$12.5 for every contract they bought and
5:04
sold every time the price moves at least
5:06
one tick so the best Market condition
5:08
for a market maker to be in the market
5:10
is when price is basically still and
5:13
when price does this or in a bigger
5:15
picture if price consolidates they're
5:18
mostly in profit the worst moment for a
5:20
market maker to be on the market is when
5:22
price is extremely directional and
5:25
extremely volatile that's why market
5:28
makers usually withdraw their order from
5:30
the order book in the milliseconds right
5:32
before and right after a macroeconomic
5:35
data release so when NFP when CPI comes
5:37
out one of the reason why price moves so
5:39
high it's not only because there's a lot
5:41
of aggression and a lot of new position
5:42
being taken but also because there's no
5:44
market makers there's no liquidity and
5:46
if you normally would have a very thick
5:48
book both on the bid both on the ask in
5:50
the seconds before and after news you
5:53
will see the book almost completely
5:56
empty and this happens in every Market
5:57
if we're talking about Market that has
5:59
FIFA with lead Market maker the market
6:02
maker is allowed to withdraw their order
6:04
from the book just in that very small
6:06
window of time if you want to get deep
6:08
into the technical details you can check
6:09
more in the CME website now back to our
6:11
Market by order data feeded with Market
6:13
by order we can access this level of
Iceberg Edge with MBO
6:15
information so the relationship with
6:16
every single little order this happens
6:18
because every aggressor order has an ID
6:21
and every resting order has an ID so we
6:23
have aggressor orders IDs and resting
6:25
order ID which is a little code that
6:27
identifies that particular order and the
6:29
best example to understand why this can
6:31
be useful is when an iceberg order is
6:33
put into the market now what is an
6:34
iceberg order you might ask an iceberg
6:36
order just like an iceberg is an order
6:38
where you can only see the tip but you
6:41
can't see that actually it's a huge
6:43
piece of order so an iceberg order is a
6:46
really big order we can say a 2,000
6:48
contract order but if a big Market
6:50
participant would put One Singular 2,000
6:53
contract order on a price level the
6:55
market is very unlikely to try and
6:57
attack it it would scare all Market
6:59
participants So to avoid this they only
7:01
put say 20 contracts just the tip of the
7:04
iceberg and every time those 20
7:06
contracts are executed by an aggressor
7:09
they immediately pop back up and they're
7:10
constantly being reloaded every time 20
7:14
contracts are executed let me show you
7:15
an example this is an example of an
7:16
iceberg order I have recorded in my
7:18
orderflow platform and as you can see
7:20
when price reaches this level there is
7:22
exactly 30 six contracts here in the
7:25
book but we can already see that
7:26
hundreds of contracts has been executed
7:28
at this level so as you can can see more
7:30
and more orders are being executed here
7:32
but still in the book there's very few
7:34
contracts and as sellers keep pushing
7:38
and selling of that level all the
7:39
contracts here are constantly being
7:41
added and reloaded again and again and
7:44
again and again more and more contracts
7:45
are executed at this price level this
7:47
shows that there is a big Market
7:48
participants behind this level
7:50
constantly reloading orders and
7:52
absorbing all the sellers pressure in
7:55
every Iceberg it's very typical that you
7:56
will find a bunch of small bubbles then
7:58
Market eventually will give up on
8:00
attacking that level because there's a
8:01
wall and price will eventually move back
8:04
up in one of the next videos we will go
8:06
deep in also how to trade this pattern
8:08
so in that level of the book this big
8:10
Market participant is constantly
8:11
reloading orders and there is two types
8:14
of icebergs so let's say that behind
8:16
here we figure out that there might be
8:17
an iceberg order and we want to sell
8:19
this there's two way to do it we can
8:21
whether sell Market on this level or put
8:24
a sell limit on this level if we sell
8:26
markets we are guaranteed to be filled
8:29
if if we put our sell limit here so we
8:31
want to sell exactly at the level where
8:33
this big participant is selling there is
8:35
two options whether this iceberg is the
8:38
same order so it's the same order ID
8:42
just quantity is constantly being
8:45
updated in which case we're talking
8:47
about a native Iceberg or it's a bunch
8:49
of different resting order that have
8:52
different order IDs which is also known
8:54
as synthetic Iceberg native icebergs are
8:56
usually provided by The Exchange
8:58
synthetic Iceberg are usually the ones
9:00
that these big Market participants build
9:02
for themselves and with the native
9:04
icebergs you are being more easily
9:06
seable by other Market participants
9:08
because they can see that it's the same
9:10
big order being constantly updated in
9:13
its quantity but the other participants
9:14
can be immediately sure it's an iceberg
9:16
order with synthetic icebergs you can't
9:19
be 100% sure it's an actual Iceberg
9:21
order because it's not the same order
9:23
being reloaded it's different orders
9:25
that are being added to the queue so
9:27
this information can be useful if you
9:28
trade BS because if there's going to be
9:31
a native Iceberg you're not going to
9:32
want to put yourself behind it because
9:34
you're probably going to be in the back
9:35
of the queue and you're never going to
9:36
be executed so if you want to bounce
9:38
this down you should sell Market with
9:40
synthetic icebergs instead you can
9:42
easily put a limit order here because
9:44
the rest of the synthetic Iceberg orders
9:45
are going to be reloaded in the back of
9:47
the quebe so you have more chances to
9:48
get infilled and this will earn you a
9:50
one tick difference which can seem like
9:52
it's not a lot but if you place your
9:54
stop loss right at the tick above and
9:55
say you're going to put a take profit
9:57
here this trade will be like 1 to 31 to
9:59
4 this trade will be a one to two this
10:01
is one way in which MBO data can help us
10:04
the biggest real concrete help it can
10:06
have is in this little detail of Iceberg
10:09
orders so it can give you a higher
10:10
advantage on trading icebergs and
10:12
absorptions so if you are a book scalper
10:14
or a micro structure orderflow scalper
10:17
this can be useful if you're a beginner
10:19
in orderflow this probably is not the
10:21
first thing you want to focus on I
10:22
mainly explain this to you so that you
10:24
really understand every granular detail
10:27
of Market mechanics before we move on
10:29
with the of course but for the price you
10:30
pay to get this information you already
10:32
need to be an experienced Trader and you
10:34
specifically need to be a scalper a very
10:37
short-term Trader otherwise if you
10:39
simply want to use orderflow and volumes
10:41
to get higher probability triggers for
10:43
your intraday strategy I would say that
10:45
investing $100 per month just for this
10:47
data feed is a bit excessive not really
10:49
useful so platforms like these ones
10:51
which I will present to you very soon
10:53
with MBO data feed can summarize all
10:55
these information with you in a chart
10:57
that we will learn how to use in the
10:58
next videos so remember to subscribe to
