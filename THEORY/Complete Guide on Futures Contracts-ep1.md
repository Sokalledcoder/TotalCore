0:00
these are trading charts how you've
0:02
always seen them these instead are
0:03
trading charts how you've always dreamed
0:05
you could see them it's basically like
0:07
having xray vision and seeing the
0:09
anatomy of Market movements and these
0:11
are orderflow charts in this orderflow
0:14
video course series I'm making on this
0:16
channel I will take you step by step
0:18
from knowing literally zero about
0:20
orderflow to being able to read it and
0:21
interpret it correctly and after back
0:23
testing it properly boost your Edge and
0:25
your profits and I will also give you a
0:27
simple but effective trading strategy
0:30
based on an orderflow manipulation
0:32
pattern that you can start back testing
0:33
right away and some other Logics that
0:35
you can apply or Implement in your price
0:37
setion strategy to optimize the daily
0:40
bias The Zone refinement process and the
0:42
entry trigger reading orderflow can give
0:44
you an almost unfair advantage on all
0:47
price action Traders showing you
0:48
information that 90% of retails are not
0:51
even aware of this stuff I'm about to
0:52
show you is usually not used completely
0:55
neglected actually by retail Traders but
0:57
if you take a look at how day Traders or
0:59
scalpers are mostly trading in the
1:01
professional environment in the
1:02
institutional side of the market they
1:04
will most likely use these charts
1:06
instead using price action is like
1:08
trying to hit the target with a normal
1:09
bow and arrow orderflow instead is like
1:11
having a ballistic bow in both of these
1:13
cases you have to be the one who shoots
1:16
properly and the ballistic one can be
1:18
kind of more expensive and maybe takes a
1:19
little bit more time to learn the basics
1:21
but once you've mastered the ballistic
1:22
option you have a higher chance to hit
1:24
the target be more precise and more
1:26
accurate or it's the same as using a
1:28
normal sniper rifle and a sniper rifle
1:30
that also has a night vision heat
1:32
scanner that shows you enemies in the
1:34
dark in both of these cases you have to
1:36
be a nice sniper but there are some
1:38
things that you will only be able to see
1:40
with night vision and let's say you're
1:41
using price action Concepts like ICT or
1:44
smart money Concepts using real
1:46
orderflow is literally like putting
1:48
those Concepts on steroids you probably
1:50
heard of order blocks or fair value or
1:53
liquidity grab or stop hunts these are
1:56
all actually orderflow patterns and
1:58
while yes with price action you can
2:00
figure them out with a fairly good
2:02
accuracy with real orderflow you can
2:04
have 100% objectivity on them you don't
2:07
have to guess that this is a stop run
2:09
you can literally see stop orders being
2:11
triggered and sweeping the book and you
2:13
can see if there's a lot of small stop
2:15
losses or it's one big stop order from a
2:18
hedge fund or a bank you don't have to
2:19
guess that the fair value Gap is from
2:21
one Wick to the next one you can be
2:23
actually way more accurate and draw it
2:25
where there's an actual Gap in Fair
2:27
Value you don't have to guess hey and
2:29
probably this candle there is an order
2:31
block which is a block of orders because
2:33
with order flow you can actually see
2:35
every single one of those blocks of
2:36
orders in other words you can make these
2:38
Concepts way more objective and very
2:41
often have a more reliable confirmation
2:43
for your entries so buckle up take paper
Course Structure
2:46
and pencil and subscribe to the channel
2:48
to be notified as soon as the next
2:50
episode is coming out cuz this is a
2:52
series of videos anyway I will link the
2:54
whole playlist for this course down
2:55
below now this course will work
2:56
something like this in this first
2:58
introduction lesson we will go deep deep
3:00
into what orderflow is what are Futures
3:02
contracts and the advantages of using
3:04
these contracts in the next videos we
3:06
will take a look at how real Market
3:08
Mechanics Work in depth how the single
3:11
orders are matched by the CME algorithms
3:14
and how the auction of these order works
3:16
then we will see how footprint or
3:18
orderflow candles work how heat Maps
3:20
work how to identify and use actual
3:23
liquidity zones then we will learn how
3:25
to interpret different orderflow
3:26
patterns and different orderflow types
3:28
of action and then we will learn how to
3:30
give all of this a context and how to
3:32
implement it in a price action strategy
3:35
or in a purely volume-based strategy as
3:37
well and last but not least we will
3:38
learn about the best platforms the best
3:40
brokers and the best prop firms so now
3:43
let's start with the basics so when
3:44
we're talking about order flow we're
Asset VS Contracts
3:46
talking about a flow of orders and we're
3:48
talking about buy and sell orders aka
3:51
the supply and the demand so seeing
3:53
order flow means seeing the supply and
3:55
the demand interacting with each other
3:57
these are also known as volumes so when
3:59
we're talking about volume usually we
4:01
refer to the total transaction between
4:03
supply and demand usually with order
4:05
flow we can be more specific about who
4:07
is more aggressive but what you need to
4:09
understand is that in order to see order
4:11
flow you need access to the exchange so
4:13
if you want to see all the volume all
4:14
the transaction traded in the Nvidia
4:16
stock in order to see the order flow of
4:18
the market participant in Nvidia you
4:20
need to go to the NASDAQ which is the
4:21
exchange that Nvidia is traded in and
4:23
access it through a data feed but with
4:26
stuff like euro dollar or GBP JPY these
4:29
are Forex payers these are currencies
4:31
and they are not traded in the same
4:33
place when we're talking about Forex
4:35
currencies are mostly traded in the
4:37
interbank spot market and unfortunately
4:40
we don't have any data on this volume
4:42
for orderflow you need a centralized
4:44
exchange whether it is for stocks or for
4:47
futures contracts and it's also
4:48
important to clarify the difference
4:49
between underlying asset and contract or
4:52
derivative so the underlying assets
4:54
usually are subdivided in asset classes
4:56
so you have stocks or equities you have
4:58
currencies you have bonds you have
5:00
Commodities you got cryptos these are
5:02
all asset classes in stocks you got
5:04
individual stocks or index funds with
5:07
currencies you have majors and minors
5:09
with bonds you have treasury bonds and
5:10
corporate Bonds in Commodities you have
5:12
precious metals energy materials and so
5:15
on and so forth these are asset classes
5:18
so unless you want to day trade all of
5:20
these things physically which is not
5:22
necessarily the best way Brokers and
5:24
Banks created derivatives so you got
5:26
cfds you got Futures you got options and
5:29
so on and so so forth so let's say we're
5:30
taking a currency pair like euro dollar
5:33
you can choose to use the cfd which
5:35
usually is named exactly euro dollar or
5:37
you can choose the Futures which is 6E
5:40
that's a slightly different name with
5:41
gbpusd you're going to have 6B if you
5:44
click here on trading View and you press
5:46
six you will see that all the currency
5:47
Futures has a six at the beginning and
5:49
then the first letter Euro British pound
5:52
Japanese Yen Australian dollar Canadian
5:54
dollar Swiss frank New Zealand dollar
5:56
and that's pretty much it so you only
5:58
have futures of some currencies but just
6:01
paired with a dollar you don't have a
6:03
lot of currency Pairs and even though as
6:04
you can see these Futures are traded in
6:06
the CME which is the Chicago mertile
6:08
Exchange their volume is really low the
6:11
Futures volume traded in currencies is
6:14
really low in fact in the latest report
6:16
of the bank of international settlements
6:17
if you go to the PDF at page six you
6:19
will see Foreign Exchange Market
6:21
turnover by instrument and you will see
6:23
the spot Market is around 30% the
6:25
outright forwards are around 15% most of
6:28
the volume is in Forex swaps currency
6:31
swaps are just 2% options and other
6:33
products which includes cfds constitutes
6:36
a very small part of it so cfd Forex
6:39
Traders are a very small percentage of
6:42
that 5% and also usually cfd Traders are
6:45
not even trading in this interbank
6:47
market they're actually trading against
6:49
their Brokers or against their prop
6:51
firms so stating that in the euro dollar
6:53
there's been a liquidity sweep of retail
6:56
Traders stop- loss is complete
6:58
and this is not an opinion this is based
7:00
on data this is facts all right let's
7:02
say gold the classic cfd is X Au USD the
7:06
future is going to be GC for an index
7:08
fund like an SNP 500 which always
7:11
remember is an index so the underlying
7:13
asset actually can't be traded other
7:16
than with derivatives like with ETFs or
7:18
futures or options or cfds so usually
7:21
the cfd will be something like us 500
7:23
and the Futures will be the micro
7:25
contract of SP which is es and so on and
7:28
so forth So when you say that you are a
7:30
Forex Trader but you actually trade gold
7:32
probably you mean that you are a cfd
7:34
Trader I mean if you're using meta
7:36
Trader 4 and cfd prop firms or a Forex
7:39
broker you are trading cfds you're a cfd
7:41
Trader not a currency Trader if you are
7:43
a currency Trader you could also use
7:46
Futures not necessarily cfds so let's
7:48
start to put things in their place all
7:50
right Forex is the asset class cfds is
7:54
the derivative now there are some clear
7:56
advantages in using Futures instead of
Futures VS CFDs
7:58
cfds cuz Futures are traded in one place
8:01
hence you have access to real volume
8:03
they are regulated they're more
8:04
transparent there is no spread markup
8:06
from the broker the cons are that margin
8:09
requirements are actually a little bit
8:10
higher you need to pay for the data feed
8:12
so to access the order flow of the
8:14
exchange you have to pay a little
8:16
monthly fee and also you need a platform
8:18
that can take this data and show it to
8:20
you in an understandable way and here
8:22
you have Footprints and heat Maps I will
8:24
show you exactly which platform I use
8:26
later on this video cfds instead are
8:28
traded in a decentralized Network so you
8:30
don't have a single exchange where you
8:32
can take the volume and the data hence
8:34
they're not that transparent they're
8:35
non-regulated they're banned in a lot of
8:37
countries your broker is adding spread
8:40
in most cases you also pay a swap for
8:42
overnight positions so maybe for a swing
8:44
Trader they're not always optimal and
8:46
yes you can choose Islamic account in
8:48
some cases in some Brokers but you
8:49
probably end up paying more in
8:50
commissions so Futures especially if
8:52
you're a long-term Trader are much more
8:54
convenient then it's also true that swap
8:56
can be positive but in most cases if
8:58
you're following a trend the the swap is
8:59
not going to be on your favor Pros are
9:01
access is easier prop firm has more
9:04
competitive and more doable I would say
9:06
challenge conditions but but these
9:08
things are not necessarily good yes
9:10
access is easier to the retail Traders
9:12
but it also means that newbies and
9:14
uninformed Traders can open an account
9:16
so easily with 50 with one to 2,000
9:20
leverage because I forgot to write
9:22
leverage can be way higher so if you are
9:24
a Ludo Maniac like most of you are you
9:26
have easier access to self-destruction
9:29
so not necessarily good same thing with
9:31
leverage which sometimes is crazy a high
9:33
and the fact that the platforms are
9:35
basically free bro if something is free
9:37
it's because you are the product because
9:39
you're paying with your spread with your
9:41
commission and with your losses or in
9:43
case of social medias and porn with your
9:44
attention and yes prop firms are more
9:46
competitiv but as we saw exactly because
9:50
rules can be too easy the financial
9:52
models of prop fir is very risky so when
9:54
you open a trade in Futures you are
Order Routing
9:56
sending the order through the broker the
9:59
broker ER also through the data feed is
10:01
sending the order to The Exchange and
10:04
the exchange through so-called matching
10:06
algorithms finds you a counterparty in
10:09
the market so the exchange finds you a
10:11
counterparty confirms the order to the
10:13
broker which gives you back the contract
10:15
with cfds instead you're sending your
10:17
order to your broker and most likely the
10:19
broker will put your order in the
10:20
so-called B book which means actually
10:22
the broker is your counterparty and even
10:25
if the broker says we are an STP broker
10:27
we are an ecn broker
10:30
99.9% of the time they are not they may
10:32
be offering you ecn prices your order
10:35
might go also straight through a process
10:38
your order might actually be processed
10:40
straight through but not straight
10:41
through the liquidity providers straight
10:43
to the b-book no dealing desk Brokers
10:45
which are very few the only one I'm 100%
10:48
sure is a no dealing desk broker is
10:50
elmax and trust me you're not getting
10:52
into these Brokers with $500 deposit
10:54
most of ecn broker only provides you ecn
10:57
prices but not an ecn execution the only
11:00
way they will provide an ecn execution
11:02
is if they put you in the aook cuz then
11:04
in the ecn which is the electronic
11:06
communication Network they will match
11:08
your order with a liquidity provider
11:10
which is usually a bank and by the way
11:12
the same goes for prop firms but I think
11:14
that with prop firms the percentage of
11:15
people that are being actually a booked
11:17
are even lower than normal Brokers so in
11:19
the Futures Market the conflict of
11:21
interest you have with the broker is
11:22
only based on commissions which is okay
11:24
so their interest is that you trade as
11:26
frequently as with highest size as
11:29
possible in cfds the conflict of
11:31
interests is commissions spreads
11:33
eventually swamps if there's a markup
11:34
also there and counterparty gain because
11:36
being your counterparty the broker is
11:38
earning money when you lose same with
11:41
prop firms so cfds are the big Casino
11:44
they are dipped in conflict of interest
11:46
but at the end of the day who gives a
11:48
if you're profitable you're
11:49
profitable both in Futures and in cfds
11:51
so in Futures you have clear advantages
11:53
like yes you don't pay a spread to the
11:55
broker there's no swap you can have
11:57
access to the order flow and it's a bit
11:59
more more romantic if you want because
12:00
you can access the market you could be
12:02
actually trading against the bank or any
12:05
other retail Trader against navinda Sara
12:07
in his bedroom or against Umar ashra or
12:09
any other retail Trader in the world so
12:11
it can be more romantic in a way but
12:13
it's not really a big deal at the end of
12:14
the day you just need to be profitable
12:16
but what are Futures as we discussed
Purpose of Futures
12:18
Futures are derivative contracts they
12:20
were originally born in the field of
12:22
Commodities in fact the cftc still holds
12:26
the name of Commodities Futures Trading
12:29
commission and they weren't necessarily
12:31
created for a speculative purpose like
12:33
cfds because cfds means contract for
12:37
difference so it's been creating for
12:41
gaining a profit speculating on the
12:44
difference between entry price and exit
12:46
price it's created for that Futures
12:49
contracts instead were originally
12:50
created for hedging purposes because
12:52
let's say you're a company you're Ikea
12:54
and you use a lot of wood and because of
12:56
a problem in the supply chain of wood
12:58
you expect the price of wood to get
12:59
higher and higher in the next month or
13:01
in the next year so instead of buying
13:03
now a huge supply of wood that you
13:06
wouldn't know where to put you can buy a
13:09
Futures Contract today which basically
13:11
entitles you at the end of the contract
13:13
which can be three 6 months one year to
13:16
buy that big pile of wood at this price
13:19
so they were created for hedging
13:20
purposes some of you may have heard
13:22
about the coot report that's the reason
13:24
why in the coot report which is the
13:26
commitment of Traders report which is a
13:28
cftc document that reports all the
13:30
position of big players in each of the
13:32
Commodities Market in each of the
13:34
Futures Market there still is the
13:36
commercial side of participants because
13:38
they're using futures for hedging
13:41
purposes for commercial purposes not for
13:43
speculation so as I said you buy the
13:45
Futures now because you think that in
13:47
the future is going to go up so you want
13:48
to cover yourself you want to head
13:50
yourself from future price movements so
13:52
you buy a future contract and at the
13:54
deadline when the contract is expired
13:57
you can take the under line commodity
13:59
but what I want to be clear here is that
Contract Specifications
14:02
there is an expiry so every Futures
14:04
Contract even the one for S&P 500 for
14:07
the Euro futures for the gold Futures
14:10
they have an expiry date usually of 3
14:12
months in fact if I write es and I open
14:15
the menu you'll find that I have March
14:17
2025 contract June 2025 September 25
14:21
December 25 and so on and so forth for
14:23
the next 5 years and each and every one
14:24
of those month has a different ticker or
14:27
name if you will June is this M over
14:30
here so es M which stands for June 2024
14:35
U is for September Zed is for December H
14:38
is for March and so on and so forth
14:40
let's open the Euro Futures also here
14:42
you have J which is April K which is May
14:45
m which is June n which is July and so
14:48
on and so forth so every one of these
14:49
contracts has a different expiry date so
14:52
when you buy a Futures and then you want
14:53
to keep it also for the next contract
14:56
for the next expiry you roll the
14:58
contract what is also known as rollover
15:01
which basically mean you get rid of this
15:02
contract and you move on to the next one
15:04
cuz this one is about to expire so every
15:06
3 months the futures of the S&P 500
15:09
expires just like with options every
15:11
single month on Friday options stop
15:14
trading and they expire on Saturday this
15:16
is for monthly options the same things
15:18
happen with Futures so when there is a
15:20
quarterly expiration of options which
15:23
usually happens at the end of every 3
15:24
months this thing is called also Opex
15:27
option expiration if it happens at the
15:29
same time that Futures also expires you
15:31
can see some weird market movement and
15:33
volatility now if I zoom in in the
15:35
contract you will notice price is moving
15:38
only
15:39
0.25 points at the time 50 75 81 8125
15:44
50. 75 0 and so on and so forth so you
15:48
have to imagine the price ladder of
15:51
Futures is not divided in Pips but in
15:53
ticks so the minimum price difference is
15:56
one tick which for the ES is 0.25 points
16:01
okay so to go from 80 to
16:04
81. 1 Point equals four ticks and how do
16:08
you calculate risk in Futures every tick
16:10
usually has a value which is called tick
16:12
value for S&P 500 is $12.5 per tick for
16:17
the micro es contract which is the mees
16:20
The Tick value is
16:22
$11.25 per tick so if you're starting
16:24
with the small Capital usually you're
16:26
going to want to opt for the micro S&P
16:28
500 or or micro contracts in general
16:30
they are a little bit more expensive
16:32
commission wise but they allow you to
16:34
enter with a smaller size and control
16:35
risk better another important thing
16:37
about Futures Contract is that you can't
16:39
open multiple positions in the same
Placing Orders
16:41
contract let's say price is here you
16:43
have no open trade your position is flat
16:46
or zero if you buy one contract your
16:49
position is plus one so this is exactly
16:51
the level you're in let's say now price
16:53
is rising up and you want to increment
16:55
your position so what you're going to do
16:57
you're going to buy one more contract
16:59
here so plus one but in Futures you're
17:01
not going to have two different one
17:03
contract positions both of these will be
17:06
mediated will be averaged into one
17:09
single position of plus two so these two
17:11
will go and you'll be left with a single
17:13
operation exactly in the middle of plus
17:16
two so your long two contracts at the
17:18
average of the two prices this is how it
17:21
works then let's say you want to head
17:23
yourself against a possible downturn of
17:25
the price so you choose to sell over
17:28
here to take this sell movement so what
17:30
you going to do let's say you're going
17:31
to sell one contract so your position
17:33
will be minus one right here but as you
17:36
press the sell button you're not going
17:37
to have a sell a new sell position here
17:39
this minus one will be taken away from
17:41
the plus two and you're just going to be
17:43
long one contract so there is no hedging
17:46
in Futures in the same contract the only
17:49
way to do this and make it actually work
17:51
like you imagine it in your mind is if
17:53
say you open long on the es and then you
17:56
short the micro contract so in the sing
17:59
contract you can't hedge and you cannot
18:01
have multiple different positions in
18:02
different contracts yes you can also
18:04
there is a slight difference how stop
18:06
losses work how take profits Works
18:08
usually if you buy one lot of euro
18:10
dollar you just place your stop- loss
18:12
right below here as your stop- loss and
18:14
maybe your take profit above here but as
18:16
I said we're just working on numbers of
18:18
contracts so since you're long one this
18:21
will equal minus one and this also would
18:23
equal minus one so if you think about it
18:25
if you're buy here and selling here and
18:28
this is the price if you put a sell
18:30
because this is minus one above the
18:32
price it's called a sell limit because
18:34
it's a sell order that will be triggered
18:36
once the price reaches this level and
18:38
hopefully then comes back the one here
18:40
is instead will be a breakout order so
18:42
it will be a sell stop so in Futures
18:45
there's actually no stop loss or take
18:47
profit these are cfd names in Futures
18:50
you will just put a sell limit and a
18:52
sell stop as a stop- loss vice versa of
18:54
course if this is your sell entry and
18:56
this is your Target and this is your
18:58
stop loss and minus one contracts they
19:00
will be simply in a plus one order and
19:03
let's say price is here this will be a
19:05
buy limit and this will be a breakout
19:07
order so a buy stop as an example this
19:10
is the order flow platform I'm using to
19:12
trade Futures and as you can see you can
19:14
buy market sell Market betas we will see
19:16
in the next part so say I'm opening a
19:18
market contract right now so let's make
19:20
an example on a simulated account to
19:23
make you understand exactly what I mean
19:24
now these candles are a little bit
19:26
different than the one you're used to I
19:27
know we will discuss the in the next
19:29
video but let's say we want to sell
19:30
we're going to set the quantity for
19:32
example five contract we're going to
19:34
sell the contract as you can see I have
19:36
five contracts open right here in order
19:38
to place myself a stop- loss I will have
19:40
to put a buy stop let's say Above This
19:43
High let's see if it's going to be taken
19:45
okay seems like price is going lower so
19:47
let's put ourself a take profit how
19:48
we're going to do it with a buy limit of
19:51
five contracts right here perfect our
19:53
take profit has been taken but as you
19:55
see + 5 equals 0 my position is flat but
19:58
this this order is still a stop order
20:00
that I placed myself to cover myself but
20:02
now I have to remember to remove it
20:03
which is kind of annoying that's why we
20:05
use Oco strategies which means one
20:08
cancels other where I can say okay five
20:10
dicks below or above you put my stop so
20:13
we're adding the first bracket and then
20:15
another Target say 10 ticks below so
20:18
we're adding this bracket we give a name
20:20
test we save it and now it's here so now
20:22
if I sell Market I will put the stop
20:25
above here the target below here will
20:27
let the price go to whichever of those
20:29
perfect as you see it hit the stop loss
20:31
and the takeprofit didn't stay there it
20:33
was canceled because one cancels other
20:36
so as you can see it can be a little bit
20:37
more complicated to get used to these
20:39
kind of things at first as with
20:40
everything it just takes a little bit of
20:42
time to learn then you set up yourself
20:43
an ooco strategy and it's done so this
20:45
was an overview of future contracts how
20:48
they work what they are in the next
20:50
video we're going to get deep into what
20:52
order flow actually is how is it
20:54
structured in extreme detail and we will
20:56
fully understand Market mechanics
20:59
how the market actually works not some
21:01
weird interbank algorithm no how Market
21:04
actually work okay so I hope you really
Conclusions
21:06
understood the power of orderflow and
21:08
how Futures Contract work if you have
