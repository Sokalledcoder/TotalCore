# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Modules
- `app/`: FastAPI backend. Key modules include `api.py` (routes), `models.py` (Pydantic schemas), `store.py` (SQLite job tracking), and `ingestion/` (Kraken fetchers). Treat this as the canonical source for business logic.
- `frontend/`: Static HTML/CSS/JS for the Fetch History dashboard. `fetch-history.js` talks to the `/api/*` endpoints; styles live in `styles.css`.
- `scripts/`: Helper utilities such as `run_api.sh` for reliable uvicorn restarts. Add new automation here.
- `docs/` & `research.txt`: Design briefs, research notes, and specs. Read before altering ingestion behavior.
- `data/`: Local Parquet/SQLite artifacts (`data/lake`, `data/jobs.db`). Never commit these.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
scripts/run_api.sh        # restart uvicorn in the background
curl -s http://localhost:8000/ # health check
```
No automated test suite yet; add pytest invocations under this section when available.

## Coding Style & Naming
- Python files follow PEP 8, 4-space indent, snake_case functions, PascalCase classes. Prefer type hints (`from __future__ import annotations` already enabled).
- Frontend JS uses ES modules and camelCase for variables. Keep CSS tokens kebab-case.
- Config/constants belong near usage (`KrakenIngestionConfig`, etc.). Avoid global singletons beyond `app = FastAPI()`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Currently manual: trigger jobs via the UI and inspect `data/lake` + `server.log`. When introducing unit tests, place them under `tests/` and run with `pytest`.
- Name future tests `test_<module>.py` and cover both ingestion success paths and failure reporting (`JobStatus`).

## Commit & Pull Request Practice
- Use descriptive, present-tense commit messages (e.g., `Add trade aggregator guard for empty chunks`). Group related changes together.
- For PRs include: scope summary, screenshots for UI tweaks, reproduction steps for bugs, and references to research docs or issues. Mention any data migrations or scripts (`scripts/run_api.sh`) that reviewers must run.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit `.venv/`, `data/lake/`, or API keys. If CCXT credentials are needed, read from environment variables.
- Before handing off, run `scripts/run_api.sh` and verify `curl http://localhost:8000/` returns `200` so reviewers can reproduce locally.

## Behavioral Expectations (Nov 2025)
- **No placeholders when real values exist.** If a command needs a repo URL, volume ID, or pod ID, paste the actual value from this repo or the current session. Never send `<org>` or “click the green button” instructions when the button isn’t verified to exist.
- **Validate assumptions against the current UI.** When giving RunPod (or any external tool) instructions, confirm the exact labels and controls visible to the user. If the UI differs, stop and document the reality instead of insisting on imaginary buttons.
- **Do not invent dependencies or tools the user doesn’t have.** If you mention `runpodctl`, local shells, or anything else, verify the user confirmed they can use it. Otherwise, stick strictly to the environment they said they have (e.g., Web Terminal only).
