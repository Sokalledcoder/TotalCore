# Hit-Test API for Polar Uniform Heatmap Renderable Series

The Hit-Test API for Polar Uniform Heatmap Renderable Series is NOT supported in SciChart.js v4.0, not because it is not possible, but because we are want feedback from our users on whether this is a feature they would like to see and if it is worth the effort to implement.

If you require hit-testing of Polar Uniform Heatmaps, contact us at https://www.scichart.com/contact-us/ to discuss your requirements and maybe speed up the process.
