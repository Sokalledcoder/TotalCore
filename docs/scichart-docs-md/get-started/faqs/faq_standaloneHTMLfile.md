# FAQ: Generating a Standalone SciChart HTML File

Sometimes you may want to share your **SciChart.js chart** with someone who doesn’t want to install npm packages, run a dev server, or manage multiple files.

Good news: you can package **all of SciChart.js (JavaScript + WebAssembly)** and your chart configuration into a **single HTML file** that runs offline in any modern browser 🚀.

This approach works by embedding the `.wasm`

file as **Base64 text** instead of a binary file.

The result is slightly larger (≈3 MB vs ≈2.3 MB) but guarantees **only one portable file**.

## When to Use This?

- ✅ Sharing a chart via email or file transfer
- ✅ Embedding SciChart inside offline docs or reports
- ✅ Creating demos for clients with no external dependencies
- ❌ Not recommended for production deployment (prefer CDNs or proper bundling)

## Step 1: Clone repo & Install dependencies

`# Clone this repo:`

git clone https://github.com/ABTSoftware/scichart.js-standalone_html_embeder

# and install dependencies:

npm install

## Step 2: Configure your chart

The repo includes a **playground file** `drawExample.js`

where you place your chart configuration.

We recommend starting in CodePen (e.g. Base Template) to quickly iterate. Once you’re happy, copy your chart setup code into `drawExample.js`

.

## Step 3: Build the offline HTML file

Run the build script:

`npm run build`

For **3D charts**, run:

`npm run build3d`

## Step 4: Done! 🎉

The script will generate:

`output.html`

This single file includes:

- Your chart config (
`drawExample.js`

) - SciChart library (
`index.min.js`

) - WebAssembly runtime (Base64 encoded)

You can now open `output.html`

in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari **without internet**.
It’s completely self-contained and portable.

**Copy-paste workflow:**Start in CodePen → copy your code → paste into`drawExample.js`

.**Offline ready:**No npm, no web server, no extra files required.**3D support:**Works the same way, just run`npm run build3d`

.**Customization:**You can style`output.html`

like any normal webpage
