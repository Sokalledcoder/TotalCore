# The SciChart.js Examples Suite

Are you new to SciChart? Check out our most popular pages to get started below:

- SciChart.js Vanilla JavaScript Tutorials
- The SciChartSurface Type
- Series or Chart Types
- Axis Types and Configuration
- Zooming & Panning
- Tooltips

- Styling and Themeing
- Chart Synchronization APIs

To make it easier to start using SciChart.js in your project, we prepared a bunch of examples demonstrating different features and their usage. These are called “SciChart.js Examples Suite” or SciChart demo.

We have two places you can view the SciChart Demo online.

**Option 1:** Browse all our examples at scichart.com/examples/javascript-chart, where demos are embedded into our website.

**Option 2:** At scichart.com/demo, where the React app is hosted. The React App demo has a counterpart Github repo here: SciChart.JS.Examples

**Note**: The SciChart website wraps & displays the React App demos inside a webpage with supplementary information. Both are good tools for exploring the feature-set of SciChart.js.

*For developers, we would recommend cloning and running the React App locally, and changing code to learn how to use SciChart.js.*

*Find the full source code for the scichart demo here: SciChart.JS.Examples*

The SciChart.js Demo React App is hosted on Github and is open source under MIT license.
