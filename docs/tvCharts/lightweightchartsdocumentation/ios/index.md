# iOS wrapper

You can find the source code of the Lightweight Charts™ iOS wrapper in this repository.

This wrapper is currently still using `v3.8.0`

. This will be updated to `v4.0.0`

in the near future.

You can use Lightweight Charts™ inside an iOS application. To use Lightweight Charts™ in that context, you can use our iOS wrapper, which will allow you to interact with Lightweight Charts™ library, which will be rendered in a web view.

## Installation

Requires iOS 10.0+

### CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate LightweightCharts into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`

:

`pod 'LightweightCharts', '~> 3.8.0'`

### Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift`

compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding LightweightCharts as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies`

value of your `Package.swift`

.

`dependencies: [`

.package(url: "https://github.com/tradingview/LightweightChartsIOS", .upToNextMajor(from: "4.0.0"))

]

## Usage

Once the library has been installed in your repo, you're ready to create your first chart.

First of all, in a file where you would like to create a chart, you need to import the library:

`import LightweightCharts`

Create instance of LightweightCharts, which is a subclass of UIView, and add it to your view.

`var chart: LightweightCharts!`

// ...

chart = LightweightCharts()

view.addSubview(chart)

// ... setup layout

Add any series to the chart and store a reference to it.

`var series: BarSeries!`

// ...

series = chart.addBarSeries(options: nil)

Add data to the series.

`let data = [`

BarData(time: .string("2018-10-19"), open: 180.34, high: 180.99, low: 178.57, close: 179.85),

BarData(time: .string("2018-10-22"), open: 180.82, high: 181.40, low: 177.56, close: 178.75),

BarData(time: .string("2018-10-23"), open: 175.77, high: 179.49, low: 175.44, close: 178.53),

BarData(time: .string("2018-10-24"), open: 178.58, high: 182.37, low: 176.31, close: 176.97),

BarData(time: .string("2018-10-25"), open: 177.52, high: 180.50, low: 176.83, close: 179.07)

]

// ...

series.setData(data: data)
